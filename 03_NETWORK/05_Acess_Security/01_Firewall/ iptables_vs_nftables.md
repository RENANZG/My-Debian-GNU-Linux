  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Introduction</td>
    <td>Traditional Linux firewall utility.</td>
    <td>Newer, unified framework for networking filtering, introduced in Linux 3.13.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Framework</td>
    <td>Based on individual tables (filter, NAT, mangle, etc.) and chains.</td>
    <td>Unified framework, with a simpler structure of tables, chains, and sets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Performance</td>
    <td>Older architecture; can be less efficient on large systems.</td>
    <td>More efficient and optimized, with better handling of complex rulesets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compatibility</td>
    <td>Works with older Linux kernels (pre-3.13).</td>
    <td>Requires kernel 3.13 or later.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Syntax</td>
    <td>Has a more complex and verbose syntax for commands.</td>
    <td>Simpler and more consistent syntax with fewer commands.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extensibility</td>
    <td>Limited extensibility compared to nftables.</td>
    <td>Supports more advanced features like sets, maps, and flowtables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rule Management</td>
    <td>Rules are managed via separate tables (filter, NAT, etc.), making it more complex.</td>
    <td>Unified rule management through the "nft" command-line tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stateful Inspection</td>
    <td>Supports stateful inspection but is more cumbersome.</td>
    <td>Built-in stateful inspection and better handling of stateful connections.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Security</td>
    <td>Good security, but lacks some modern features for defense against complex attacks (e.g., set-based operations).</td>
    <td>Enhanced security, with more advanced features like dynamic set management, improved logging, and better handling of modern threats.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Adoption</td>
    <td>Widely used and has been the default firewall tool for many years.</td>
    <td>Gaining adoption, but still newer and not as universally deployed.</td>
