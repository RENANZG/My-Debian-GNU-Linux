# Qubes OS Notebook Security Measures

## Physical Security Measures

### 1. Hardware Acquisition:
- Purchase a reliable and secure laptop model known for its compatibility with Qubes OS, such as the [Dell Latitude E6230](https://www.dell.com) or [Lenovo ThinkPad X230](https://www.lenovo.com).

### 2. Airgap the Device:
- **Remove Unnecessary Components:** Physically remove the webcam, microphone, speakers, and Bluetooth module to minimize potential attack vectors.
- **Install Hardware Kill Switches:** Add physical switches to enable or disable the Wi-Fi and other connectivity features.

### 3. Write-Protect the BIOS/UEFI:
- Enable write protection on the motherboard BIOS/UEFI to prevent unauthorized firmware changes. Refer to detailed instructions specific to your laptop model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_protection).

### 4. Hardware Upgrades:
- **Upgrade RAM and SSD:** Install the maximum supported RAM and upgrade to a high-capacity SSD. For example, upgrade to 16GB RAM and a 1TB SSD. [Crucial](https://www.crucial.com) offers compatible upgrades.
- **Solder RAM to Motherboard:** If possible, solder the RAM chips directly onto the motherboard to prevent tampering. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) about RAM and [soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder).

### 5. Tamper-Proofing:
- **Apply Epoxy Glue:** Use epoxy glue to secure screws and seams around the laptop, making it tamper-evident. Focus on areas like the bottom panel and around the screen. [Epoxy Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy).
- **Install Port Blockers:** Use port blockers to secure all unused ports, preventing unauthorized access. [Lindy Port Blockers](https://lindy.com/en/technology/port-blockers/).

### 6. BIOS/UEFI Password Protection:
- **Set Strong BIOS/UEFI Passwords:** Protect BIOS/UEFI settings with a strong password to prevent unauthorized changes. [How to set BIOS password](https://www.howtogeek.com/74583/how-to-set-a-bios-or-uefi-password/).

### 7. Physical Intrusion Detection:
- **Use Tamper-Evident Stickers:** Place tamper-evident stickers on screws and seams to indicate if the laptop has been opened.

## Virtual Security Measures

### 1. Install and Verify Qubes OS:
- **GPG Verify:** Download Qubes OS from the [official site](https://www.qubes-os.org) and verify the integrity of the installation media using GPG. [How to verify](https://www.qubes-os.org/security/verifying-signatures/).
- **Install Qubes OS:** Follow the [official installation guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/installation-guide/) from the Qubes OS website.

### 2. Operating System Security:
- **Regularly Update Qubes OS:** Ensure that Qubes OS and all templates are regularly updated to protect against vulnerabilities. [Update Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/updating-qubes-os/).
- **Use Encrypted Storage:** Enable full disk encryption during the installation process to protect sensitive data. [Disk Encryption Guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/disk-encryption/).

### 3. Kernel and Boot Security:
- **Install Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG):** Enhance kernel security by installing LKRG. Follow the guide on [Kicksecure](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG/Qubes).
- **Install Anti Evil Maid (AEM):** Protect against boot-time attacks by implementing AEM. Detailed instructions are available on the [Qubes OS website](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/anti-evil-maid/).

### 4. Authentication and Access Control:
- **Set Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for the BIOS/UEFI and all Qubes OS accounts. [Password Strength Guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/password-guidelines/).
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Use MFA for accessing critical Qubes OS domains to add an extra layer of security. [MFA Setup Guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/multi-factor-authentication/).

### 5. Network Security:
- **Use VPNs and Tor:** Route network traffic through VPNs and the Tor network where possible to enhance privacy and security. [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org).
- **Enable Firewall:** Configure and enable the Qubes OS firewall to restrict network access. [Firewall Configuration](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/firewall/).

### 6. Secure Configuration:
- **Limit USB Access:** Disable USB ports in BIOS/UEFI if not needed. Use Qubes OS USB qubes to isolate USB devices. [USB Quarantine](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb-qubes/).
- **Minimize Software Installations:** Only install necessary and trusted software. Use Qubes OS templates to manage software and minimize attack surfaces. [Template Management](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/).

### 7. Backup and Recovery:
- **Regular Backups:** Regularly backup important data using secure, encrypted backup solutions. [Backup Guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/backup-restore/).
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Have a clear plan for recovering your system in case of a breach or hardware failure. [Disaster Recovery](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/disaster-recovery/).

### 8. Secure Communication:
- **Use Encrypted Email:** Use encrypted email services and clients such as [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) or configure [PGP encryption](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/pgp/) for your emails.
- **Use Secure Messaging Apps:** Communicate using secure messaging apps like [Signal](https://signal.org).

### 9. Monitoring and Auditing:
- **Log Monitoring:** Regularly review system logs for suspicious activities. [Log Analysis Guide](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/logging/).
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Consider using IDS tools to monitor for unauthorized access or changes.

## Advanced Security Measures

### 1. Enhanced BIOS/UEFI Security:
- **Flash BIOS with Coreboot:** If supported, replace the proprietary BIOS/UEFI with Coreboot to reduce firmware vulnerabilities. [Coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/).
- **Firmware Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of firmware, such as using TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for boot verification.

### 2. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):
- **Use HSMs for Key Management:** Employ hardware security modules for storing cryptographic keys securely. [HSM Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module).

### 3. Cold Boot Attack Mitigation:
- **Disable Sleep and Hibernate:** Configure your system to disable sleep and hibernate modes to mitigate cold boot attacks. [Cold Boot Attack Mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack).

### 4. Compartmentalization:
- **Use Disposable VMs:** Leverage Qubes OS disposable VMs for sensitive tasks to ensure that no data persists after the VM is closed. [Disposable VMs](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/disposablevm/).
- **Advanced VM Isolation:** Use multiple VMs with strong isolation for different tasks to limit the impact of potential breaches.

### 5. Secure Boot Enhancements:
- **Custom Secure Boot Keys:** Use custom Secure Boot keys to prevent unauthorized OS installations. [Custom Secure Boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Using_your_own_keys).
